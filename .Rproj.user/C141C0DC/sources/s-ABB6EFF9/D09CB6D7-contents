#Module 03 Microbial Species Concepts Evidence worksheet_05 "Extensive mosaic structure"

#### Learning Objectives
*Evaluate the concept of microbial species based on environmental surveys and cultivation studies
*Explain the relationship between microdiversity, genomic diversity and metabolic potential
*Comment on the forces mediating divergence and cohesion in natural microbial communities

#### General Questions:
*What were the main questions being asked?

How do the 3 different E.coli strains (CFT073, EDL933, and MG1655) differ from each other in terms of genome composition? How do these differences reflect on their pathogenicity in intestinal diseases?

How does lateral gene transfer contribute to the emergence of new uropathogenic E. coli strains and the characteristic of lifestyle and disease-causing traits?

*What were the primary methodological approaches used?

Clones and sequencing:

The sequencing data was assembled by SEQMANII and the genome sequence was anotated using MAGPIE. GLIMMER was used to define the ORFs

The nr/nt database from BLAST was used to explore potential protein sequences

Used a 90% identity match of CFT073 in either MG1655 or EDL933, where alignments included at least 90% of both genes, and lack of equivalent match in other locations in CFT073 genome was used to infer orthology.

*Summarize the main results or findings

Through lateral gene trasnfer, new genes arise in the genome of E. coli leading to distinct lineages. As a result, the backbone itself is evolutionarily conserved through vertical gene trasnfer while the differences between species stem from teh different pathogenicity islands.

It is the
